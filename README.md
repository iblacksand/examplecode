# examplecode

- Advanced Card Probability.pdf is a jupyter notebook that I made to simulate a problem for probability written in Python using matplotlib
- BodyModelCodeMatlab.pdf was a project for one of my classes. It models different organs in the body and the result of anemia. BodyModelCode is a folder containing the physical code
- BPM.py is a Python command line interface for a heart rate monitor project. It uses pyfirmata to connect to an arduino. It then uses numpy, scipy to process the data, and matplotlib to display the results.
- consistency.m is the code for my most recent CPAP project. It takes in the raw voltage from a pressure sensor and determines the frequency of the change in pressure and also converts voltage to pressure. DeviceFigures.pdf shows how the code is able to account for sensor drift as the data was taken continously over multiple days
- ellipticpairs.py was from my research into elliptic primes at Boise State University. It is able to find elliptic pairs and then create LaTeX graphs to show the results.
- PadlockAutoFormSubmit.user.js is a script that is able to exploit a vulnerability in a password manager
- PyMathTools.py is a small python library I made for the elliptic prime project. It conains lightweight math functions so we didnâ€™t have to use bloated math libraries.
